src_vipa is provided under the terms of the enclosed common public license
("agreement"). Any use, reproduction or distribution of the program
constitutes recipient's acceptance of this agreement.


Package contents:
=================

The src_vipa package includes the following files:
LICENSE         Common Public License Version 1.0
README          this readme
Makefile        src_vipa's Makefile
src_vipa.c      src_vipa's source code
src_vipa.8      src_vipa's manual page


Changes in version 2:
=====================

src_vipa 2 supports multiple VIPAs per destination and several policies
how the VIPAs are distributed over several connections. See the man page
(man ./src_vipa.8 or man src_vipa) for rationale and details.
Note, that the layout of the configuration file has changed since the
1.x versions - see the migration section below and the man page.


Installation:
=============

For installation by hand, you might want to change the paths in the
Makefile (clean paths would be:
SRC_VIPA_PATH=/usr/lib
SRC_VIPA_STARTER_PATH=/usr/sbin
), at least you should check them. Make sure that the starter script is
in the path, when you want to start applications.

make
make install


The config file:
================

Please see the man page (man ./src_vipa.8 or man src_vipa) for details
about configuring src_vipa.


Migration from earlier versions:
================================
The layout of the configuration file has changed. Please see the man
page (man ./src_vipa.8 or man src_vipa) for details.
Check your syslog (usually in /var/log/messages) for problems the first
times you use a new version.


Usage:
======

src_vipa.sh <application incl. parameters>

This enables the application which is started with source VIPA functionality.
The config file is read once at the starting of the application. You can
even change the starter script and have multiple applications run using
different src_vipa settings by having different environment variables
SRC_VIPA_CONFIG_FILE.


Restrictions:
=============

LD_PRELOAD security prevents setuid executables to be executed under
src_vipa; that kind of programs can only be executed when the real UID is 0.
ping usually is installed setuid.
The maximum number of VIPAs per destination is defined as 8.
Only user space applications can be made use src_vipa. Kernel code does
not care about this package.


Alternatives:
=============

The tool ip can tweak the routing table ("ip route x src y"). Less
flexible, sometimes less powerful, but does source VIPA as well.
